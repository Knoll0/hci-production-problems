  <h1>Why PT Serif and PT Sans work well together</h1>
  <p>
    The first and best reason that I chose the both of these to go together is that they are meant to. From the about tab
    on google fonts. "PT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together
    with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design." They were created by the same guy
    and compliment each other through rules 3 (Embrace the other) and 4 (Explore the past) from the typeconnection rules.
