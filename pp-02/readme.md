## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=12L0u0k9sig4Asd7dmNaWciikaX
Your Rationale: The reason that I chose this palette was because green conveys a new beginning and a new console 
gaming platform is like that new beginning. I also went with a lighter closer to mint green color to let it pop more 
and to be more clean and professional versus an edgier approach

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=51Y0w0ko0mNeuvyjJqyrRiwypd9
Your Rationale: I went with a more yellow/green/orange palette for this one to convey a warm and nature-like feeling.
The lighter green resembling the plants and nature that is part of the gardens while the yellow and orange represent
the seasons turning warm again and a happier and sunny time.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=30d0V0ks4tchmAQmluKu9nhzmil
Your Rationale: Here I have a red-orange color with a blue and a yellow-green color. Yellow would be a main color 
being a bit lighter while red and blue would be the accent colors. The yellow would go to give a sense of happiness 
and hope in this new time for the child while red would try to instill some passion into them. The blue would be more 
of an accent color to show the responsibility of the site and that it is a serious teaching website.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=b3p57040kinjB9PteeInVmJg0rTb6
Your Rationale: I went with more muted colors here, with a cyan, red-orange, and lavender to give the sense of 
professionalisma and responsibility while also trying to instill some passion, energy, and creativity in order to seal 
a deal and get people to enroll into the course. The muted colors make a more calming feeling to any potenetial 
students as well.
