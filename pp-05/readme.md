## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. https://drpete.co/blog/25-point-website-usability-checklist
2. https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Site Load-time Is Reasonable
2. Users usually expect that your site’s main logo will link to your homepage, so make sure you’ve done this.
3. Font Size/Spacing Is Easy to Read
4. Does your site render correctly in different devices? Use responsive design and your website will render correctly to all visitors.
5. Company Logo Is Linked to Home-page
6. Add concise and comprehensive hints to the input fields. Sometimes when questions are ambiguous or complicated, instructions are
   essential. If the instruction itself is very short, place it near the input field. If the explanation is longer, it is better to 
   put it near the form.
7. Styles & Colors Are Consistent
8. Minimizing users’ input you will gain more accurate data. Don’t ask for things that are not necessary.
9. When a user makes a mistake or misses a question, warn them, so that they can write it properly. If you can check the correctness 
   of the information, display a tick (when it is correct) or a cross (when there is something wrong) near the field.
10. Have you arranged information properly? Make it easy for users to find what they’re looking for by grouping related information 
    together.
